Operating system fingerprinting is a technique used to identify the type and version of an operating system running on a remote host. It is commonly used in network security, penetration testing, and system administration. Automating the process of operating system fingerprinting through a script can simplify and streamline this procedure. This document presents a script that performs operating system fingerprinting tasks, utilizing various network-level and application-level techniques.


Requirements:
Python programming language (version 3.x)
Scapy library (for packet manipulation and sniffing)
Python-nmap library (for network scanning, optional)
Operating system fingerprint database (for comparison and matching)

Script Structure:
Import the necessary libraries:
pythonCopy code
import scapy.all as scapy
import nmap
# Add any additional libraries required for database access or matching

Define functions:
Send TCP SYN packet and capture response:
pythonCopy code
def send_syn_packet(target_ip, target_port):
    packet = scapy.IP(dst=target_ip) / scapy.TCP(dport=target_port, flags="S")
    response = scapy.sr1(packet, timeout=1, verbose=False)
    if response:
        # Process response and extract relevant information (e.g., TCP flags, TTL)
        return response
    return None

Perform operating system fingerprinting:
pythonCopy code
def fingerprint_os(target_ip, target_ports):
    fingerprints = []
    for port in target_ports:
        response = send_syn_packet(target_ip, port)
        if response:
            # Extract TCP flags, TTL, or any other relevant information for fingerprinting
            # ...
            fingerprint = # Create a fingerprint based on the extracted information
            fingerprints.append(fingerprint)
    return fingerprints

Match fingerprints with the database:
pythonCopy code
def match_fingerprints(fingerprints, database):
    matched_os = []
    for fingerprint in fingerprints:
        # Compare the fingerprint with the entries in the database
        # Identify the best match or calculate similarity scores
        # Add the matched operating system to the list
        matched_os.append(matched_os)
    return matched_os

Define target IP and ports:
pythonCopy code
target_ip = '192.168.0.1'  # Replace with the IP address of the target host
target_ports = [22, 80, 443]  # Replace with a list of target ports to be scanned

Perform operating system fingerprinting:
pythonCopy code
fingerprints = fingerprint_os(target_ip, target_ports)

Load the operating system fingerprint database (optional):
pythonCopy code
database = load_os_database()  # Load the database with known operating system fingerprints

Match fingerprints with the database (optional):
pythonCopy code
matched_os = match_fingerprints(fingerprints, database)

Display results:
pythonCopy code
if matched_os:
    for os in matched_os:
        print("Operating System identified:", os)
else:
    print("No match found in the database.")

The presented operating system fingerprinting script provides a basic framework for identifying the type and version of an operating system running on a remote host. It utilizes network-level techniques, such as sending TCP SYN packets and analyzing the responses, to extract relevant information for fingerprinting. Additionally, the script offers the option to compare the obtained fingerprints with a pre-defined operating system fingerprint database. This script serves as a starting point for further customization and expansion to suit specific requirements and incorporate additional fingerprinting techniques or matching algorithms.
